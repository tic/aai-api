# Plug Obstructors

This folder contains CAD files for the "plug obstructors" we used when deploying sensors into areas where it was common for devices to get unplugged. In an effort to minimize how often this happened, we 3D printed simple frames which surround the plug, make the system appear more complex, and (hopefully) make it less of a target for unplugging. We made three versions of the device, slightly modifying it each time to make the fit better, the model stronger, and make it more difficult to remove the USB cable from the power adapter once the obstructor was installed. A view of the plug obstructor v3 in Solidworks 2020 is provided below.

In our experiments, these obstructors were found to be quite effective. Without the frames, at least three devices were unplugged in the first week of sensors being deployed. After adding these frames to each plug, no sensors have been unplugged in the subsequent six weeks, despite traffic through monitored spaces increasing as a result of more students being around studying for their final exams.

In the image above, we show how the obstructors are intended to function. The 5V power adapter is lodged into the frame and secured with a strip of white gaffer's tape. Once secured, the frame makes it impossible to easily separate the USB cable from the power adapter. This makes the plug less susceptible to being unplugged for two reasons:

1. The plug looks more complicated. We hypothesize that added visual complexity will reduce unwanted interactions, such as the device being unplugged.
2. The USB cable and power adapter are more difficult to separate. An issue we encountered was with cables and adapters being stolen, presumably by those needing to charge a device. Since the other end of the USB cable is secured in the back of the sensor, the obstructor makes it impossible to use one of these components to charge a personal device without a substantial amount of further interaction.

In the above photo, we have an example of a plug obstructor deployed with a sensor. Although not shown in the picture, the obstructor does not interfere with the outlet directly below it.
